# TUTORY
------------------------------

### ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This full-stack project was completed by a 3-dev team with the goal of creating a fully functional web-app for users to interact with. It was born out of the idea to provide everyday people with the opportunity to become teachers in the fields that they excel in. Users can quickly and easily create custom tutorials without having to register for any more than a basic user profile. Users are not required to login to view the tutorials, but once logged in, a user can add their favorite tutorials to a watchlist to watch anytime. 

Tutory was built from the ground up, including a PostgreSql database, a Node & Express server, and a Javascript frontend. User authentication is included using JWT, as well as styling using Materialize and Bootstrap.
